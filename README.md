This is test React/Redux application created to try new es6 features and react/redux stack.

It's displaying Premiership season 2016/2017 games grid for selected round and overall leaderboard.

Teams get 3 points for each game won, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a game lost.
If two or more teams have the same number of points, better ranked team would be the one
with better goal difference. In case the goal difference is also equal, team with a higher number
of goals scored would be ranked higher.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To play with it, just clone repository and `run npm` start in cloned folder.
